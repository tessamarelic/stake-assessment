# üß™ Front-End Technical Assessment
### Data Integration and Design-to-Code Precision with Component Library  

**Frameworks:** Angular, Ionic  
**Estimated Time:** 4~ hours  
**Submission Platform:** [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/) for hosting the project is required. Github link can be shared as well along with stackblitz.

## üìñ Scenario  
You'll be working with a provided **[Figma Design](https://www.figma.com/design/STwysTPYIZfV3pzNm1TvMq/FE-Test-%7C-2?node-id=1-3&p=f&m=dev)** to complete this challenge. The focus is **data integration**, **design fidelity** and **component creation**, we want to see how closely you can translate design intent into front-end code, while building in a way that anticipates future changes.  

Within the Figma file, you'll find a section titled **"Components"**, which includes:  
- **Card**  
- **Instrument**  
- **Type**  

You'll also see **one animation sequence** in the section titled *"Order form protoype"*. Frame steps are visible there, and you can view the prototype by pressing **Shift + Spacebar** or via this link:  
üëâ [Figma Prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/STwysTPYIZfV3pzNm1TvMq/FE-Test-%7C-2?node-id=1-15642&m=dev&scaling=min-zoom&content-scaling=fixed&page-id=1%3A3&starting-point-node-id=1%3A15642)

## üìù Tasks  

1. Use Angular 14+ and Ionic 7+
2. **Implement the Invest and Discover page** as shown in the Figma mockup.  
3. **Implement the BUY animation sequence** based on the frame steps provided.  
4. **Design an ideal API / data source for your equity positions**:  
   - Define the structure of the data you would expect from one or more APIs.  
   - Be realistic: don't assume all necessary data will come from a single endpoint.  
   - Show how this data structure would power your components effectively.  

---

## üéØ Focus Areas  

- **Design Precision**  
  Your implementation should match the provided Figma designs as closely as possible (spacing, typography, component behavior and animation accuracy etc.). Don't be afraid to lean in to the framwork to assist with component creation.

- **Component Thinking**  
  Build components in a way that allows them to be reused and updated. Future design changes should be easy to accommodate.

- **API / Data Modeling**  
  Propose a realistic and well-structured holdings data source that reflects how a front-end developer would typically consume APIs. Other data sets required have been provided.

- **Data Integration & Composition**  
  Use the provided data sources directly, or combine them when needed, to supply your components with the most relevant view models. Structure your solution with RxJS in mind, ensuring state management is both considered and functional. If you are using Angular 16 and up we still want to see some use of RxJS observables.

---

## üì¶ Deliverables  

- A working project.  
- A **README** describing:  
  - Any design assumptions you made.  
  - How your components were structured to handle future design updates.  
  - The data source/API design you created and how it connects to your implementation.  
- The implemented **Invest and Discover** pages and **order purchase animation sequence**.  

---

## üïë Time Expectation  

This task is designed to take around **4 hours (hard cap 4)**, but we understand everyone works differently. Please don't over-engineer; focus on **quality and detail**, not quantity.  

Please stop at the cap and note trade-offs or unfinished items in the README. Focus on design fidelity, clean componentisation, the animation, and a realistic API/data model. Extras are optional.

---

## üìñ Ionic use

- Use Ionic's tab layout - you can easily get a tab starter template set up via Ionic's commands.
- Don't be afraid to lean in to the Ionic Framework to provide the basis of your [components](https://ionicframework.com/docs/components) to get them set up quickly.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

- Where the design doesn't explicitly define behavior (e.g. hover states, edge cases, other), make thoughtful assumptions and clearly document them.  
- Access to the Figma file is password-protected. The password will be provided by a member of the Stake team along with when this task is handed over.
- Please ensure you can log in to a free Figma account to use the Inspect tools effectively to complete the challenge - note, you will not have access to "development mode". Use the "Layers" on the left hand side to access individual sections in order to see their styles.

## üö´ What to Avoid

- Do not include references to Stake developers or real company code
- Focus on your best practices, clean code, and component architecture

## üìé Submission

- Please host your project on [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/) or provide a GitHub repo link
